# Cascade Deletion Fixes

## Problem
The original database schema had cascade deletion relationships that would accidentally delete shared workout content (tracks, sessions, blocks, exercises) when a user profile was deleted. This was dangerous because:

1. **Shared Content Loss**: Deleting one user could delete workout tracks that other users were subscribed to
2. **Data Integrity Issues**: Sessions and exercises used by multiple users could be removed
3. **Business Logic Violation**: Workout content should persist even when users leave

## Solution Applied

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Changes

**Changed from CASCADE to RESTRICT for shared content:**

- `user_track_subscriptions.workout_track_id` → `workout_tracks.id` (RESTRICT)
- `user_session_completions.session_id` → `sessions.id` (RESTRICT)  
- `sessions.track_id` → `workout_tracks.id` (RESTRICT)
- `blocks.session_id` → `sessions.id` (RESTRICT)
- `block_exercises.block_id` → `blocks.id` (RESTRICT)
- `block_exercises.exercise_id` → `exercises.id` (RESTRICT)

**Kept CASCADE for user-specific relationships:**

- `user_session_completions.track_subscription_id` → `user_track_subscriptions.id` (CASCADE)
- All social media tables still cascade properly
- Profile and auth relationships remain cascaded

### 2. Updated User Deletion Function

The `delete_user_data()` function now:

- **Safely deletes user data** without affecting shared content
- **Checks table existence** before attempting deletions
- **Follows proper deletion order** to avoid foreign key conflicts
- **Includes error handling** with detailed logging

### 3. Admin Workout Management

Added `delete_workout_track()` function that:

- **Prevents deletion** if users have active subscriptions or completions
- **Safely removes** workout content in proper dependency order
- **Provides admin control** over shared content lifecycle

### 4. Monitoring View

Created `user_data_summary` view to:

- **Track user data counts** across all tables
- **Monitor cascade relationships** for debugging
- **Support GDPR compliance** reporting

## What This Means

### ✅ Safe User Deletion
- Users can delete their accounts without affecting other users
- Personal data (subscriptions, completions, social posts) is removed
- Shared workout content remains intact

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Workout tracks persist even when all subscribers leave
- Exercise library remains stable
- Session programming is preserved

### ✅ Business Continuity
- Workout content has independent lifecycle from users
- Admin control over shared content deletion
- Proper separation of user data vs. content data

## Usage Examples

### Delete User Account (Safe)
```sql
-- This will only delete the user's personal data
SELECT delete_user_data('user-uuid-here');
```

### Admin: Delete Workout Track (Protected)
```sql
-- This will fail if users are subscribed or have completions
SELECT delete_workout_track('track-uuid-here');
```

### Monitor User Data
```sql
-- View user data summary for cleanup planning
SELECT * FROM user_data_summary WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

## Migration Files

1. **20241215_scalable_workout_schema.sql** - Creates the workout schema
2. **20241216_fix_cascade_deletion.sql** - Applies cascade deletion fixes

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. Create test users with subscriptions and completions
2. Delete a user account using `delete_user_data()`
3. Verify workout tracks and sessions still exist
4. Verify other users' data is unaffected
5. Check that user's personal data is completely removed

## GDPR Compliance

This implementation ensures:

- **Complete user data removal** when requested
- **Audit trail** of deletions via function logging
- **Shared content preservation** for business continuity
- **Admin controls** for content lifecycle management
